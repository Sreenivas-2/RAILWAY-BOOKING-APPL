<h2>Testing and Features:</h2>
<p>This application is a sample of ticket booking system with core<br>
concept of concurrency when multiple users try to book same ticket<br>
at the same time.When we run the project first dialog requires us toi<br>
enter the account details to Log into the app.If the user doesnâ€™t<br>
have an account he can create it also.</p>

<p>After log in ,user needs to select the origin and destination of</p>
<p>his/her journey and the date of the journey.Booking is allowed only<br>
upto same date of next month.</p>

<p>After that he/she needs to select the seats he/she like.A disabled<br>
seats means that it already booked and seats selected will be<br>
displayed in red color.</p>

<p>After that user needs to confirm the terms and conditions and make<br>
payment.A timer will be started and he/she should should make<br>
payment before the timer ends or else the tickets will be lost.After<br>
selecting the confirm booking that seats will be locked and before<br>
the timer ends these seats cannot be booked by anyone.</p>

<p>When the server goes off accidentally the data is in the server backed up to into two files<br>
named 1.details.txt -> which stores the details of user and his journey
      2.seats.txt -> which stores the seatmatrices.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>File test.cpp runs the test and makes sure that concurrency in the server is working fine.<br>
It creates multiple users who try to book same ticket and ensures that only one user books it.<br>
g++ test.cpp -pthread -o output <br>
./output</p>
